The Agat World War II Amtrac is an underwater relic of World War II, located off Ga'an Point in Agat Bay on the west side of the island of Guam.  It is the remains of an LVT 4, an amphibious tracked landing vehicle.  It is located about 500 yards (460 m) off Agat Invasion Beach in 45 feet (14 m) of water, and was described as being in good condition when it was discovered and surveyed in 1985.  These vehicles were used during the 1944 Battle of Guam, in which American forces recaptured the island from occupying Japanese forces.  This particular vehicle does not appear to exhibit significant war damage. This is the most intact of the three Amtracks remaining on Guam from the 850 that participated in the battle. It was re-surveyed by maritime archaeological field schools conducted from 2009 to 2012.It is administratively part of the Agat Unit of War in the Pacific National Historical Park. The Amtrac is the occasional topic of National Park Service ranger presentations. The submerged wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.
