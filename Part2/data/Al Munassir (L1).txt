Al Munassir was an amphibious warfare vessel operated by the Royal Navy of Oman.  It was purchased to enable the kingdom to respond to threats to the strategically important Musandam Governorate. The vessel was launched in 1978 and, after decommissioning, was sunk as an artificial reef in 2003. It is now a popular diving site.
