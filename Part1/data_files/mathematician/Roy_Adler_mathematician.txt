Roy Lee Adler (February 22, 1931 – July 26, 2016) was an American mathematician.
Adler earned his Ph.D. in 1961 from Yale University under the supervision of Shizuo Kakutani (On some algebraic aspects of measure preserving transformations). He then worked as a mathematician for IBM at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center.
Adler studies dynamical systems, ergodic theory, symbolic and topological dynamics and coding theory. The road coloring problem that was solved by Avraham Trakhtman in 2007 came from him, along with L. W. Goodwyn and Benjamin Weiss.
He was a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. A paper was written on his work and the impact of his work by Bruce Kitchens and others.
