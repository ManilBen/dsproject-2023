His principal writings are "Physical Phenomena attendant upon Solar Eclipses", read before the American Philosophical Society in 1848; a paper on the "Fundamental Principles of Mathematics," read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1848; another on the "Origin of the Forms and the Present Condition of some of the Clusters of Stars and several of the Nebulae", read before the American Association in 1850; others on the "Form and Equatorial Diameter of the Asteroid Planets" and "Harmonies in the Arrangement of the Solar System which seem to be Confirmatory of the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace", presented to the National Academy of Science; and a "Statement and Exposition of Certain Harmonies of the Solar System", which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1875.
