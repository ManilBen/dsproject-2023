Sergio Albeverio (born 17 January 1939) is a Swiss mathematician and mathematical physicist working in numerous fields of mathematics and its applications. In particular he is known for his work in probability theory, analysis (including infinite dimensional, non-standard, and stochastic analysis), mathematical physics, and in the areas algebra, geometry, number theory, as well as in applications, from natural to social-economic sciences.
He initiated (with Raphael Høegh-Krohn) a systematic mathematical theory of Feynman path integrals and of infinite dimensional Dirichlet forms and associated stochastic processes (with applications particularly in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and quantum field theory). He also gave essential contributions to the development of areas such as p-adic functional and stochastic analysis as well as to the singular perturbation theory for differential operators. Other important contributions concern constructive quantum field theory and representation theory of infinite dimensional groups. He also initiated a new approach to the study of galaxy and planets formation inspired by stochastic mechanics.


== Life and career ==
Albeverio is the son of Olivetta Albeverio Brighenti (1910–1968, tailor and then housewife) and Luigi (Gino) Albeverio (1905–1968, plumber and then owner of a small company of heating and plumbing). He grew up in Lugano, Switzerland. He is married to Solvejg Albeverio Manzoni (painter and writer) since 1970. They have a daughter, Mielikki Albeverio (dipl. socialsc.).
Study of mathematics and physics at the ETH Zürich with a Diploma Thesis (1962) under the direction of Markus Fierz and David Ruelle, and a PhD Thesis (1966) under the direction of Res Jost and Markus Fierz.
Assistant at ETH Zürich (1962–67), visiting lecturer at Imperial College (1967–68, R. F. Streater). Invitation by Irving Segal as co-worker (MIT, 1968–69), replaced by a year stay as teacher at Liceo Cantonale, Lugano, due to family reasons.
Research Fellowship at Princeton University (1970–72, A. S. Wightman). Visiting Professorships at University of Oslo (1973–77, R. Høegh-Krohn), University of Naples (1973–74, G. F. Dell'Antonio), University of Aix-Marseille II (1976–77, D. Kastler, R. Stora).
