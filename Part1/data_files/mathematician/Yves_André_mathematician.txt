Yves André (born December 11, 1959) is a French mathematician, specializing in arithmetic geometry.


== Biography ==
André received his doctorate in 1984 from Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris VI) with thesis advisor Daniel Bertrand and thesis Structure de Hodge, équations différentielles p-adiques, et indépendance algébrique de périodes d'intégrales abéliennes. He became at CNRS in 1985 a Researcher, in 2000 a Research Director 2nd Class, and in 2009 a Research Director 1st Class (at École Normale Supérieure and Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu – Paris Rive Gauche).


== Research ==
In 1989, he formulated the one-dimensional-subvariety case of what is now known as the André-Oort conjecture on special subvarieties of Shimura varieties. Only partial results have been proven so far; by André himself and by Jonathan Pila in 2009. In 2016, André used Scholze's method of perfectoid spaces to prove Melvin Hochster's direct summand conjecture that any finite extension of a regular commutative ring splits as a module.


== Awards ==
In 2011, André received the Prix Paul Doistau–Émile Blutet of the Académie des Sciences. In 2015, he was elected as a Member of the Academia Europaea. He was an invited speaker at the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro and gave a talk titled Perfectoid spaces and the homological conjectures.
