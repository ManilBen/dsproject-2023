Stephanie Brewster Brewer Taylor Alexander is an American mathematician, a professor emerita of mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Her research concerns differential geometry and metric spaces.


== Education and career ==
Alexander earned her Ph.D. from UIUC in 1967, under the supervision of Richard L. Bishop, with a thesis entitled Reducibility of Euclidean Immersions of Low Codimensions. After joining the UIUC faculty as a half-time instructor, she became a regular faculty member in 1972. She retired in 2009.


== Books ==
With Vitali Kapovitch and Anton Petrunin, Alexander is the author of the book An Invitation to Alexandrov Geometry: CAT(0) Spaces (Springer, 2019).


== Recognition ==
At Illinois, Alexander won the Luckman Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching Award and the William Prokasy Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1993.
In 2014 she was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society "for contributions to geometry, for high-quality exposition, and for exceptional teaching of mathematics."
