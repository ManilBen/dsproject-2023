She is listed on the Bletchley Park Roll of Honour as having been a bombe operator at an out-station in Stanmore. Ascherson eventually entered the Royal College of Art in 1945 and studied there for two years. By that time she had already had paintings accepted for display by the Royal Academy during the war and the Contemporary Art Society had acquired a terracotta work by her. In 1947 she married and moved to Provence in France and in 1948, as Pamela Rachet, wrote and illustrated a book, C'etait Heir - St Remy du Provence, on the region. Her first solo exhibition was held at the Berkeley Gallery in 1953. A series of paintings on racing cars made by Ascherson in the 1960s were acquired by the Donington Park Racing Museum. Duncan Campbell Contemporary Art held exhibitions of Ascherson's sculpture in 1993 and 1998.Her younger half-brother is the journalist Neal Ascherson.
