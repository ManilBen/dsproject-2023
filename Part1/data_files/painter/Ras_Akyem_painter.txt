Ras Akyem (sometimes called Ras Akyem Ramsey or Ras Akyem I Ramsey) is a Barbadian painter.  A graduate of the Edna Manley School of Art in Jamaica, his work is heavily influenced by the Rastafari movement and bears resemblance to the paintings of Jean-Michel Basquiat.  His work is frequently exhibited alongside that of Ras Ishi Butcher.
